                <p>Welcome to the 2023–24 issue of Inputs & Outcomes! Published mere months after our network of exceptional public charter schools celebrated its 25th anniversary, we are also tipping our (10-gallon) hats to our 10th anniversary in the state of Texas. </p>

                <p>This issue of Inputs & Outcomes presents the best of BASIS.</p>

                <p>The best of BASIS is, simply, consistent excellence. Our best isn’t a one-off. Rather, ‘the best of BASIS’ means that we do in every academic year what others may hope to achieve one time, someday. Our best is the best—this year, last year, next year, and every year.</p>

                <p>The best of BASIS means education from the best educators in America, utilizing the best curriculum in the country. That’s why our incredible students and supportive families come to BASIS</p>

                <p>The best of BASIS is innovation and creativity, plus enthusiasm and dedication—not from one place or source, but from many smart people in many places, with a shared passion to serve as a conduit to the best public education in America.</p>

                <p>The best of BASIS means exceptional curricular and pedagogical inputs, resulting in excellent student outcomes.</p>

                <p>That’s why we are here: all of us.</p>

                <p>“The best of BASIS” may seem familiar, customary, and recognizable. We sure hope so.</p>

                <p>That’s precisely the point.</p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>

                <p>The mission of BASIS Charter Schools is to empower students to achieve at globally competitive levels with our transformative K-12 academic program.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>

                <p>Since 1998, BASIS has hired exceptional, expert educators to teach a rigorous academic program to eager students, and achieved exceptional results by doing so, whether assessed campus by campus, or student by student. Our teachers have seen firsthand for more than a quarter century that if you raise the standards of student learning, any student can rise to meet those standards, and exceed them.</p>

                <p>The classroom is key. Ours are energized by prioritizing demonstration of deep learning by utilizing projects, presentations, and comprehensive assessments to gauge each student’s intellectual journey. Through hands-on activities and collaborative projects, we ignite critical thinking and foster a love for learning that even extends far beyond the classroom.</p>

                <p>All told, we offer students timeless principles: dedication to hard work; embracing accountability; perseverance in the face of challenges; and recognizing your education as the ladder to achieving your aspirations. Our students therefore become participants, not spectators, in the competitive global landscape.</p>

            <p>The extracted agave juice is then poured into either large wooden or stainless steel vats for several days to ferment, resulting in a wort, or mosto, with low alcohol content. This wort is then distilled once to produce what is called ordinario, and then a second time to produce clear "silver" tequila. A minimum of two distillations is required by law. A few producers such as Casa Noble (for their "Crystal" expression) and Corzo (for their añejo expression) have experimented with distilling the product a third time, but this has not caught on as a trend, and some have said it removes too much of the agave flavor from the tequila. At this point the tequila is either bottled as silver tequila or it is pumped into wooden barrels to age, where it develops a mellower flavor and amber color</p>

            <p>The differences in taste between tequila made from valley and highland agave plants can be noticeable. Plants grown in the highlands often yield sweeter and fruitier-tasting tequila, while valley agaves give the tequila an earthier flavor.</p>

            <p>By regularly trimming any quiotes (a several-meter high stalk that grows from the center of the plant), the jimadores prevent the agave from flowering and dying early, allowing it to fully ripen. The jimadores determine when each plant is ready to be harvested, and using a special knife called a coa (with a circular blade on a long pole), carefully cut away the leaves from the piña (the succulent core of the plant), which can average around 70 kg (150 lb) in the valley to 110 kg (240 lb) in the highlands.

A few producers such as Casa Noble (for their "Crystal" expression) and Corzo (for their añejo expression) have experimented with distilling the product a third time, but this has not caught on as a trend, and some have said it removes too much of the agave flavor from the tequila.
